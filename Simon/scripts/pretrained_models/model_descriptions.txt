FILENAME <=> DESCRIPTION (list of corresponding classes)
------------------------

Base_faker.pkl <=> faker-trained checkpoint of base classes (Categories_base.txt is the list of classes; weights in text-class.19-0.02.hdf5)

Base.pkl <=> transferred from faker-trained checkpoint of base classes above to real data with no extra classes (Categories_base.txt is the list of classes; weights in text-class.17-0.04.hdf5)

Base_stat.pkl <=> base classes + categorical/ordinal (Categorical_base_stat.txt is the list of classes; text-class.20-1.55.hdf5 the weights)

Base_stat_geo.pkl <=> base+categorical/ordinal+geographic (Categorical_base_stat_geo.txt is the list of classes, note we call categorical/ordinal "statistical" or "stat" classes; weights in text-class.19-0.06.hdf5)


PS => for each model of use, modify config.ini at top level for docker deployment, and replace Categories.txt in scripts/ folder with the corresponding list of Categories (note that these will be sorted in alphabetical order in the end, when interpreting results)
